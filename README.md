# Haloo3d

A simple software renderer written in C which is made specifically for games
I might want to make. It is not made to be highly configurable or to follow any
kind of guidelines or APIs. It will most likely not be very pretty or performant.

It renders into a 16 bit buffer of A4R4G4B4, which you can do whatever you want 
with.
