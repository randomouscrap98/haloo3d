# Haloo3d

<img src="https://qcs.shsbs.xyz/api/file/raw/ffqbz" alt="a 3d software renderer">

A simple software renderer written in C which is made specifically for games
I might want to make. It is not made to be highly configurable or to follow any
kind of guidelines or APIs. It will most likely not be very pretty or performant.

It renders into a 16 bit buffer of A4R4G4B4, which you can do whatever you want 
with. 

## Structure

The main library handles all the 3D tasks and is provided by just
[haloo3d.h](haloo3d.h) and [haloo3d.c](haloo3d.c). This "core" library is compiled
by default when you run `make`. But when actually doing things, you will 
want the `full` library, which includes helper functions for loading
`.obj` files, loading `.ppm` files into textures, debug printing into
the framebuffer, and other things. It may be wasteful but it's usually
easier to build and include this library. 

To create the full library and link against it, run:

```
make full
gcc -o myprogram main.o haloo3d_full.a -lm
```

You will need to link libmath, of course (ugh). You can of course just
compile only the portions you need instead. In the process of building
`haloo3d_full.a`, it also builds all the requisite `.o` files for each
portion of the extended library, so you can include only what you need.

## Testing

There's a lot of examples in the examples folder, but some of them may be
broken. I use the examples as a testing ground and if the library changes,
the "examples" break. I should probably name them "test_samples" or something.

### Scene.c

The main file for testing is currently [examples/scene.c](examples/scene.c). 
You can compile this with:

```
make examples/scene.exe
```

This will automatically compile the core library, the extended library, and
link it all into the scene example, producing the file you passed to make.
You can then run it like:

```
./examples/scene.exe model.obj texture.ppm camera.cam
```

The model is a standard wavefront obj file, though I wrote a custom parser
and it might not like all the files. The texture is any .ppm image. You can
convert an image to ppm with imagick:

```
convert texture.png texture.ppm
```

It should automatically be in the right format, but just in case it's not, 
these programs only load P6 binary ppm images.

The camera file is a simple flat file where each line has 5 floats:
- x offset
- y offset
- z offset
- yaw (radians)
- pitch (radians)

Don't believe the program if it says degrees: it's radians. There are a couple
python programs you can use to generate interesting cameras. Currently, I use
[examples/makecam2.py](examples/makecam2.py), which generates a camera which 
rotates around the "mountain" generated by `scene.c`. Your object is placed on 
top of the mountain, unscaled. I use this one as a control when testing 
performance.
